# üìã Lab 3: Logarithm Tables

## üéØ Objective

In this lab, you will write a C++ program that generates a formatted table of logarithm values. The user will specify a **minimum** and **maximum** value, as well as how many rows should appear in each **section** of the output. 
The table should be displayed in clearly separated sections, each with a repeated header and aligned columns.

This is an attempt of a recreation of my CS1 Lab 3. There was a whole story involving Babbage, the analytical engine, and Ada Lovelace... Admittedly, it gave me a rough time, but I came out bettter for it. So I pass this down to you. Good luck!

## üìù Program Requirements

1. Prompt the user to enter three **positive integers**:
   - A **minimum value**
   - A **maximum value**
   - A **section size** (number of rows per group)

2. Validate the input:
   - All values must be positive
   - `minimum ‚â§ maximum`
   - `section size > 0`

3. Print a table of values in sections of `section_size` rows:
   - For each value in the range `[min, max]`, display:
     - The value
     - Its base-10 logarithm: `log10(x)`
     - Its natural logarithm: `log(x)`

4. Format the table:
   - Each section should be **preceded by a dashed border** and a **repeated column header**
   - Columns must be neatly aligned using `setw`, `fixed`, and `setprecision(4)`

## üñ•Ô∏è Sample Execution

```
Enter the minimum value: 1
Enter the maximum value: 12
Enter the section size: 4

      11       1.0414     2.3979
      12       1.0792     2.4849
```

## üí° Hints

- Use `#include <cmath>` for `log10()` and `log()`
- Use `#include <iomanip>` for `setw`, `setprecision`, `fixed`
- Use a helper function to print the dashed line and header before each section
- Use a counter to detect when you're starting a new section

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation and Execution

To compile your code:
```bash
make
```

To run your program:
```bash
./main
```
## ‚úíÔ∏è Submission Instructions

-  Push your finished program and ensure your code passes all tests.
-  Click the green checkmark and copy and paste the URL of the resulting page into Brightspace.
- Your code must **compile and run** without errors.

## üß© Optional Challenge

Let the user choose which columns to display: `log10`, `ln`, or both. This requires a menu and conditionally printing each column.
